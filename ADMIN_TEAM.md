# Admin team

The current `super_admin` keeps full access. Existing state/district admins are unchanged. New accounts created at `/super-admin/team/` use the separate `scoped_admin` role without Django staff or superuser privileges.

## Use

1. Open Super Admin > Admin Team > Create admin.
2. Enter name, unique mobile number and password with confirmation.
3. Select a state (for example Tamil Nadu or Delhi), or choose All states.
4. Select the sections the admin may moderate. Select all listed sections for a state-wide content moderator, or only Jobs for a Jobs admin.
5. The new admin signs in at `/login/` with their mobile number and password. `/dashboard/` sends them to `/admin-workspace/`.

Edit access or suspend/reactivate accounts in Admin Team. Changes apply to existing sessions on the next request. These accounts cannot create other admins, use Django admin, or enter the older unrestricted admin panels.

## Sections

| Section | Delegated actions |
| --- | --- |
| Jobs | Approve or suspend postings; employer is notified |
| News | Publish or unpublish stories; original publication dates are preserved |
| Offers | Activate or suspend offers |
| Ads | Approve or reject ads, using the existing ad duration; owner is notified |
| Communities | Verify/activate or suspend communities |
| Quiz | Activate or suspend quizzes |
| Coupon shops | Activate or suspend shops |
| Voucher businesses | Approve or suspend businesses |
| Flicks | Review and permanently delete a flick, with explicit confirmation |

Billing, coupon issuance, rewards, voucher purchases, paid plan verification, geography and global settings remain with the Main Super Admin. New roles use dedicated moderation screens; they are not given blanket access to existing section back offices.

State access uses the record's pincode and the existing PinCode > District > State mapping. Offers use the owner's pincode; Flicks use the uploader's pincode. Unmapped locations are invisible to state-scoped admins, but remain available to the Main Super Admin and national section admins. Missing/deleted/inactive state assignments fail closed.

## Deployment

Apply the additive migration before restarting the application:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_states
python manage.py check
```

No existing roles are converted and no accounts are created automatically.
`seed_states` adds missing states and union territories for the Assigned State dropdown. It preserves existing state records, inactive states and pincode mappings, and is safe to run again.

## Validation

```sh
python manage.py test jobs.test_assigned_admin jobs.test_marketing jobportal.test_ga4 --settings=jobportal.test_settings
```

Tests cover role creation, forged privilege fields, state/section isolation, legacy endpoint bypass attempts, account suspension, permission changes, CSRF, login routing and preservation of Main Super Admin access.
